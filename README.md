# Insurance Cost Prediction
Predicting insurance costs using machine learning for informed decision-making.

# Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict insurance costs based on relevant factors. The model is trained on a dataset containing key features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. By utilizing this predictive model, users can estimate insurance costs more accurately.

# Key Features:
Data preprocessing pipeline
Machine learning model for cost prediction
User-friendly interface for input and result retrieval
# Usage:
Clone the repository: git clone [repository_url]
Run the prediction script: python predict_insurance_cost.py
Follow the prompts to input relevant data for prediction.
# Dataset:
The dataset used for training is included in the data directory. Feel free to explore and expand the dataset for improved model performance.

# Requirements:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
